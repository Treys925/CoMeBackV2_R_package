# CoMeBackV2
Co-methylation of adjacent array probes, taking into account genomic CpG background. Function cmr() constructs co-methylated regions based on pair-wise positive correlations above variable correlation threshold.  The threshold increases linearly from a low value for low-density CpG background to a high value for high density background.  Pearson Corrlation is used.
